> Overall structure

Overview of attempts, summits, deaths, and success rate by year.

Seasonality and route analysis (spring vs autumn; Nepal vs Tibet).

Weather vs summit success (wind, temperature, storms).

Consistent color coding:

Success - green 

Attempt - blue

Death - red

> Page 1 – Attempts and success overview

Key visuals:

- Line chart: attempts vs successful summits per year.

- Line/area chart: success rate (%) per year or per decade.

- Card visuals: total attempts, total summits, total deaths, overall success and fatality rate.

Filters:

- Slicers for decade, side (Nepal/Tibet), season (month or quarter)

Insights to aim for:

- Show how attempts and summits have increased over time.

- Show whether success rate and death rate are improving or stable.

> Page 2 – Season, route, and crowding

Key visuals:

- Clustered column chart: success rate by season (pre-monsoon vs post-monsoon).

- Bar chart: attempts and success rate by route/side.

- Scatter or column chart showing “number of climbers on summit day” vs success rate or vs deaths.

Possible fields:

- Season derived from summit/attempt date.

- Route side (South Col vs North Ridge, etc.).

Insights to aim for:

- Identify the safest and most successful seasons and routes.

- Highlight the effect of crowding (large numbers on the same day) on outcomes.

> Page 3 – Weather vs summit success

Weather measures to include at or near summit push:

- Wind speed

- Temperature (minimum and average)

- Weather code

Visual ideas:

- Scatter chart: wind speed vs summit success rate, colored by season.

- Scatter chart: temperature vs success rate, sized by number of climbers.

- Heatmap or matrix: success rate by wind-speed band (e.g., <20 km/h, 20–40, >40) vs temperature band.

- Line chart overlay: average wind speed on summit days vs success rate by year.

Insights to aim for:

- Identify “safe” weather windows (e.g., wind below a certain threshold).

- Show how climbers increasingly target narrow low-wind periods.

> Page 4 – Risk and outcomes

- Column chart: deaths per year vs attempts per year (with death rate line).

- Bar chart: cause of death (exposure, fall, avalanche, altitude illness) vs weather context where possible.

- Histogram or column chart: age bands vs success rate and death rate.

Insights:

- Reveal how bad weather correlates with specific types of incidents.

- Highlight vulnerable groups (e.g., very high winds plus crowding, inexperienced climbers in marginal weather).
